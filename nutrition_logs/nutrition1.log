## Nutrition Assessment

**1. Significant Nutrient Discrepancies:**

* **Protein:** You consumed 9.74g, which is 80.8% under your goal of 50g.
* **Carbs:** You consumed 59.36g, which is 78.4% under your goal of 275g.
* **Fat:** You consumed 2.48g, which is 96.4% under your goal of 70g.
* **Fiber:** You consumed 9.8g, which is 60.8% under your goal of 25g.


**2. Positive Nutrition Choices:**

You made a good choice by including carrots and chapathis in your diet. Carrots are a good source of beta-carotene (converted to Vitamin A) and fiber. Chapathis, while low in fat, provide some carbohydrates and fiber.  The small amount of milk contributes some protein and calcium.  However, the overall quantity of food consumed is significantly low.

**3. Recommendations for Tomorrow:**

Your current intake is far below your daily goals in almost all macronutrients.  This indicates you need to significantly increase your food consumption to meet your energy and nutrient needs.  It's important to note that without knowing your activity level, body composition goals (weight loss, maintenance, gain), and any underlying health conditions, these recommendations are general guidelines.  Consult a registered dietitian or nutritionist for personalized advice.


1. **Increase Protein and Healthy Fats:** Add a source of lean protein like 100g of grilled chicken breast (approx. 30g protein) or 2 eggs (approx. 12g protein) to your meals.  Incorporate healthy fats by adding 1 tablespoon of olive oil to your cooking or including a small portion of avocado (approx. 5g fat).  These additions will help boost your protein and fat intake significantly.

2. **Boost Carbohydrate Intake:** Increase your carbohydrate consumption with more complex carbs, like an additional 2-3 chapathis or a portion of brown rice (approx. 50g carbs per cup cooked).  Focus on whole grains for added fiber.

3. **Include More Fruits and Vegetables:** Add a serving of fruits (like a medium apple or banana) and more vegetables (like a cup of spinach or a large salad) to your diet.  This will increase your vitamin, mineral, and fiber intake.  Consider adding a larger portion of carrots (perhaps 5-7) to reach your daily fiber goal.

4. **Consider Portion Sizes:** While increasing your intake is crucial, pay attention to portion sizes to meet your calorie goals without overshooting. You can use a food scale to measure portions accurately, especially for proteins and carbs.


**Important Note:** The significant discrepancies in your nutrient intake suggest you may need to reassess your daily goals (particularly the calorie, protein and fat goals).  Consider consulting a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to determine appropriate nutrient targets based on your individual needs and activity levels.  Your current goals might be too high or too low, and adjusting them is crucial for sustainable and healthy eating habits.
