4. Pin the extension to your toolbar for easy access

## üß© How It Works

### Recipe Analysis System

#### AI Model Integration

1. **Vision Language Model (VLM) Request**: 
   - When a food image is uploaded, it's sent to the backend where Gemini 1.5 Flash (or alternatively Hugging Face's BLIP model) analyzes the image
   - The VLM identifies the food and generates a detailed description of what's in the image
   - No fine-tuning required - the models use zero-shot learning to identify food items

2. **First LLM Request - Recipe Analysis**:
   - The food description is sent to Gemini 1.5 Flash 
   - The LLM analyzes the food, listing main ingredients, nutritional estimates, and health considerations
   - This creates the "Recipe Analysis" section

3. **Second LLM Request - Recipe Modification**:
   - Using the food analysis, another prompt is sent to the LLM
   - Based on the selected dietary goal (low-carb, high-protein, vegetarian, vegan), the model creates a custom recipe from scratch
   - The prompt specifically requires detailed measurements, cooking instructions, and health benefits

4. **Third LLM Request - Flavor Enhancement**:
   - A separate LLM request generates culinary suggestions to improve the modified recipe
   - This includes spice recommendations, sauce ideas, and presentation tips

5. **Optional LLM Requests - Q&A**:
   - Users can ask custom questions about the food
   - Each question generates a new LLM request with context from previous analyses
   - The model provides personalized answers about nutrition, cooking techniques, or cultural aspects

6. **Final LLM Request - Telegram Summary** (when sharing):
   - When sending to Telegram, an LLM request generates a concise, well-formatted summary
   - This includes only the essential information, optimized for messaging platforms

### Nutrition Tracking System

#### Telegram Bot Integration

1. **Natural Language Food Logging**:
   - Users message the Telegram bot with what they've eaten (e.g., "I had 2 eggs and toast for breakfast")
   - First LLM Request: Gemini extracts food items from natural language
   - The extracted food items are processed using a hybrid approach:
     - First attempt: USDA FoodData Central API lookup for accurate nutritional data
     - Backup: LLM-based estimation when USDA doesn't have the data
   - The bot responds with immediate nutritional analysis of the logged food

2. **Daily Nutrition Summary**:
   - Users can use the `/summary` command at any time to get their daily totals
   - Second LLM Request: Gemini analyzes all foods logged that day
   - The LLM compares intake against recommended daily values
   - It provides personalized recommendations based on nutritional gaps or excesses
   - All context from previous food entries is maintained

3. **Chrome Extension Integration**:
   - The "Track Today's Nutrition" button in the extension connects to the same data
   - The FastAPI server acts as a bridge between the Telegram bot and Chrome extension
   - Food logs are stored in a JSON file that both systems can access
   - Third LLM Request: When retrieving data for the extension, the LLM provides recommendations based on all nutrition context

## üí° Future Enhancements

### 1. MCP Integration
- Implementing the system with MCP (Model Context Protocol) would allow:
  - Scheduled notifications without requiring always-on servers
  - More efficient context management between multiple LLM calls
  - Better long-term memory for tracking nutrition trends

### 2. Advanced Analysis
- Tracking nutrition across multiple days/weeks
- Visualizing nutrition trends over time
- Suggesting meal plans based on nutritional gaps

### 3. Mobile Integration
